Mastodon requires a load balancer or reverse proxy to properly terminate TLS/SSL connections between users and ingress traffic to the system.
Nginx is commonly used for this purpose, and [an example configuration](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/blob/main/dist/nginx.conf) is provided in the Mastodon respository.
There are no specific version requirements for Nginx, and other types of software can be used in place of Nginx, such as Caddy for example.

::warning
Regardless of the ingress software that is used, you should keep it up to date to prevent exploitation of known security vulnerabilities.
